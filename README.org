* Postgres Based timesheet application
** How to use
   Initial startup & usage
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make docker-start  # just so that it doesnt muck with any other postgresql's
   make createdb   # creates the "timesheet" repo, *"public" may or may not be deleted*
   PROJECT=work make schema # creates the "work" timesheet schema
   PROJECT=personal make schema  # createst the "personal" timesheet schema
   make clockin REASON="Go to job" PROJECT="work"
   make clockin REASON="Do some personal stuff" PROJECT="personal" # Won't work! you're still clocked into work!
   make clockout REASON="go home" PROJECT="work"
   make clockin REASON="Go shopping" PROJECT="personal"  # Good, don't mulitask, it's bad for you.
   #+END_SRC
   
   What was done:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make today PROJECT=work # what did I work on today
   make all-tasks PROJECT=personal # show me ALL my personal tasks done...
   #+END_SRC
   
   Backing up & restore
   Email config:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cat <<EOF > .credentials.yml
     email:
       username: some.email@gmail.com
       password: password
       recipients:
         - who.getsthis@email.com
         - who.else@eeeemail.com
     EOF
   #+END_SRC
   Actual backup and restoration
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make backup  # creates a file and tries to mail it to you...
   make restore BACKUP=timesheet_$(sometimestamp).sql
   #+END_SRC
   
   debug
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   make psql  # logs you into the dockerized postgres. Our examples should have three schemas "work", "personal" and "common"
   make resetdb # WIPE EVERYTHING! destroy everything and rebuild database (no schemas)
   #+END_SRC

** Goals
   - learn postgres, pgsql
   - learn Make
   - have something useful from the experience
   - learn Python3 asyncio
   - be able to write a story about what happened on what day.. 
** Features
   - commandline tool to log timesheets
   - backup functionality (email for now, until we can figure out staging a proper replication strategy)
   - simple cli based
   - export to xls/csv?
   - restore functionality (needs to be fixed)
** TODO-list
   - today total times
   - Selective note addition (notes to any periods, post mortem)
   - RESTful API
   - Multiple notes to a period.
   - Supervisor job to monitor system state?
   - Log when sleep, wake ? OSX version:

* NOTES:
  - Schemas vs dbs vs vs ..
    [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5678902/postgresql-schemas-usage-scenario-case][Great link on Stack overflow]]
    So let's assume I want to do this per user.. then a schema per user idea would be great, however, this would mean that I can't nest schemas. And if I'm already using schemas then it's a design flaw. Perhaps I should revisit the idea of common, work, private schemas.
  - The schema... ideas:
    Perhaps the period table should be common among projects? You can't be working on more than one thing at a time.(#OPINIONATED!)
  - some async code for reference
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    import aiopg
    import asyncio
    from aiohttp import web

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    app = web.Application(loop=loop)


    async def get_today():
        conn = await aiopg.connect(database='timesheet',
                                   host='127.0.0.1')
        cur = await conn.cursor()
        await cur.execute("SELECT * FROM timesheet.today")
        retval = []
        async for elem in cur:
            return elem

    async def index(request):
        values = await get_today()
        for value in values:
            print("..",values)
        return web.Response(text="Hello there")


    app.router.add_get("/", index)
    web.run_app(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=8088)

  #+END_SRC

** endpoints
   - POST /timesheet/new  # create a new schema ?
   - GET /timesheet/{id|name}
** projects?
   /project/1/period or /project/takealot/period and /project/hackytime/period
   Apparently you get template databases but not template schemas. Template schemas are not formalised so create a schema, then apply tables to that schema. Common sql tables file?
